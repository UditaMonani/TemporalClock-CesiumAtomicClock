# TemporalClock: Ultra-Precision Temporal Drift Prediction

## Concept
**TemporalClock** is a deep learning project designed to forecast microsecond-level clock drift and synchronization errors with high precision. Inspired by the stability and complex dynamics of Cesium atomic clocks, this model aims to provide not only accurate predictions but also reliable uncertainty estimates.

## Why Precision Matters
In many critical systems, time is the most important measurement. Ultra-precise clock synchronization is fundamental for:
- **Satellite Navigation & Communication (e.g., ISRO, NASA):** Ensuring accurate location data and coherent communication links.
- **Defense and Aerospace (e.g., DRDO):** Synchronizing radar arrays, electronic warfare systems, and secure communication networks.
- **Telecommunications:** Maintaining the stability of 5G/6G networks.
- **Financial Trading:** High-frequency trading relies on microsecond-level timestamps.

This project tackles the challenge of predicting clock drift, which is affected by complex factors like thermal variations, periodic interference, and long-term aging effects.

## Architecture: A Hybrid Approach
To capture the intricate dynamics of clock drift, TemporalClock uses a novel hybrid architecture that fuses time-domain and frequency-domain features.
